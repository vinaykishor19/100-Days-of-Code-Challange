### Day 0: October 2, 2022 [Calculator App]

**Today's Progress**: Learned linear gradient in css and how to implement light and dark theme in project using Javacript

**Thoughts:** it was really confusing in the beginning but as i watched some tutorials on youtube and did some research it becomes easier on the go.
